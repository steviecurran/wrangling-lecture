# Wrangling lecture

A lecture on introductory data wrangling for my 3rd year Physics and Space Science students. 

Given in conjunction with two notebboks:

- Ex1.ipynb, which uses data we worked with in 2nd year for the of concepts mean, variance, the central limit theorem and A/B testing

  Here it is used to introduce dataframes and how these can be combined

- Ex2.ipynb, which uses data on the number of fires in the Amazon rainforest, to demonstrate some data cleaning:

    - Renaming parameters (column names), including the use of dictionaries
    - Identifying problems with the data
    - Stripping strings
    - Missing values
    - Grouping data
    - Visualisation
    - Time Series
    - Significance and correlation
      
  Which shows that the number of fires has been steadily increasing over the range of the data (1998 - 2018)
